# Evaluation Protocol

## Step 1: First Pass — Knowledge Delta Scan

Read SKILL.md completely and for each section ask:
> "Does Claude already know this?"

Mark each section as:
- **[E] Expert**: Claude genuinely doesn't know this — value-add
- **[A] Activation**: Claude knows but brief reminder is useful — acceptable
- **[R] Redundant**: Claude definitely knows this — should be deleted

Calculate rough ratio: E:A:R
- Good Skill: >70% Expert, <20% Activation, <10% Redundant
- Mediocre Skill: 40-70% Expert, high Activation
- Bad Skill: <40% Expert, high Redundant

## Step 2: Structure Analysis

```
[ ] Check frontmatter validity
[ ] Count total lines in SKILL.md
[ ] List all reference files and their sizes
[ ] Identify which pattern the Skill follows
[ ] Check for loading triggers (if references exist)
```

## Step 3: Score Each Dimension

For each of the 8 dimensions (see `references/evaluation-dimensions.md`):
1. Find specific evidence (quote relevant lines)
2. Assign score with one-line justification
3. Note specific improvements if score < max

## Step 4: Calculate Total & Grade

```
Total = D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 + D5 + D6 + D7 + D8
Max = 120 points
```

**Grade Scale** (percentage-based):
| Grade | Percentage | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| A | 90%+ (108+) | Excellent — production-ready expert Skill |
| B | 80-89% (96-107) | Good — minor improvements needed |
| C | 70-79% (84-95) | Adequate — clear improvement path |
| D | 60-69% (72-83) | Below Average — significant issues |
| F | <60% (<72) | Poor — needs fundamental redesign |

## Step 5: Generate Report

```markdown
# Skill Evaluation Report: [Skill Name]

## Summary
- **Total Score**: X/120 (X%)
- **Grade**: [A/B/C/D/F]
- **Pattern**: [Mindset/Navigation/Philosophy/Process/Tool]
- **Knowledge Ratio**: E:A:R = X:Y:Z
- **Verdict**: [One sentence assessment]

## Dimension Scores

| Dimension | Score | Max | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----|-------|
| D1: Knowledge Delta | X | 20 | |
| D2: Mindset vs Mechanics | X | 15 | |
| D3: Anti-Pattern Quality | X | 15 | |
| D4: Specification Compliance | X | 15 | |
| D5: Progressive Disclosure | X | 15 | |
| D6: Freedom Calibration | X | 15 | |
| D7: Pattern Recognition | X | 10 | |
| D8: Practical Usability | X | 15 | |
